## Ocaml Portfolio
Another rendition of my portfolio website, but in Ocaml.

## Usage
You can copy the following snippet to get this project up and running:

``` bash
git clone https://www.github.com/joshua-mo-143/ocaml-portfolio
cd ocaml-portfolio
export PORT=8000
make up
```

This does the following:
- Clones this GitHub repo
- Changes working directory to the repo
- Sets an environment variable (port) to be 8000.
- Sets the project up and starts it at port 8000 (or whatever you've decided to use as the value for the port).
